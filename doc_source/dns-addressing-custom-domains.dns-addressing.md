# Support for DNS addressing in AWS Global Accelerator<a name="dns-addressing-custom-domains.dns-addressing"></a>

When you create an accelerator with an IPv4 IP address type, Global Accelerator provisions two static IPv4 addresses for you\. It also assigns a default Domain Name System \(DNS\) name to your accelerator, similar to `a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com`, that points to the static IP addresses\. 

For accelerators with dual\-stack IP address types, Global Accelerator provides a total of four addresses: two static IPv4 addresses and two static IPv6 addresses\. Global Accelerator creates a new DNS name that points to both the A record and the AAAA record that points to all four IP addresses\. The new DNS record enables Global Accelerator to upgrade an accelerator to dual\-stack without affecting clients that currently reference the original DNS record that is not dual\-stack\. An example DNS name for an accelerator with dual\-stack IP addresses is the following: `a1234567890abcdef.dualstack.awsglobalaccelerator.com`

The static addresses are advertised globally using anycast from the AWS edge network to your endpoints\. You can use your accelerator's static addresses or DNS name to route traffic to your accelerator\. DNS servers and DNS resolvers use the [round\-robin DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_DNS) process to resolve the DNS name for an accelerator, so the name resolves to the static IP addresses for the accelerator, returned by Amazon Route 53 in random order\. Clients typically use the first IP address that is returned\.

**Note**  
For each IPv4 and IPv6 address associated with your accelerator, Global Accelerator creates a Pointer \(PTR\) record that maps an accelerator’s static IP address to the corresponding DNS name generated by Global Accelerator, to support reverse DNS lookup\. This is also known as a reverse hosted zone\. Be aware that the DNS name that Global Accelerator generates for you isn't configurable, and you can't create PTR records that point to your custom domain name\. Global Accelerator also does not create PTR records for static IP addresses from an IP address range that you bring to AWS \(BYOIP\)\.
